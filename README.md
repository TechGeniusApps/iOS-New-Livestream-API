# iOS-New-Livestream-API

Objective-C client for retrieving data from "New Livestream" API. This framework uses the undocumented, but official API from Livestream. Since this API is undocumented, it may change server-side at any time, but I play to update this framework ASAP when one of those changes occurs.

## Why you should use this
